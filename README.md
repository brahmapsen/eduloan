Provide education loan using crowd sourcing and blockchain

College and higher education is expensive in the USA. Most aspiring students take educational
loans which typically ranges above a compounded interest rate of 6-10%. This becomes a huge
financial burden to students which discourages some not to pursue or drop out of college or pick
up a job not to the best of their abilities.

edloan.me
Edloan.me is a platform that allows a student to avail financial help at a much reduced rate than
traditional 6-10% rate.
● It uses crowdfunding in the form of loan with interest, donation or scholarships as the
lender desires.
● The money will be paid to the educational institutions directly to avoid any misuse of the
intent of the fund.
● The denomination may not be limited to any particular currency.
● It uses a decentralized network (Blockchain) where the individual identity is managed by
the lender and borrower themselves without any loss of privacy.
● The platform allows the loan process to occur as a Contractual agreement between the
borrower and lender without any third party intermediation, thus reducing administrative
cost, faster loan adjudication and lower interest rate.
● The collateral for the loan would be the standard process that occurs when one takes a
regular loan from a bank or any other entity.
● Student's credit checking may be used as part of their digital identity in the Blockchain
system using zero knowledge proof to maintain data privacy.
● The platform would buy 3rd party insurance to account for "defaults" in the loan
repayment process so that lenders are protected.
Note: There are other Blockchain based lending services being developed by start ups but they
are using the traditional banking and lending institutions. :

Process Flow:
1. Identify Permissioned Blockchain platform to host the product
